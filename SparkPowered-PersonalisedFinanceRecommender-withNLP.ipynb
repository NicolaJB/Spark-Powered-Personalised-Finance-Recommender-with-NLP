    "# **Spark-Powered Personalised Finance Recommender with NLP**\n",
    "This demo showcases an end-to-end scalable pipeline that combines Spark’s big data processing capabilities with advanced NLP techniques to analyse customer sentiment from financial product reviews. It leverages collaborative filtering (ALS) for personalised recommendations and sentiment analysis to augment or explain user feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline explicitly manages cold-start scenarios using coldStartStrategy=\"drop\", ensuring that predictions are only generated for valid user–item pairs seen during training. For explicit user–item predictions (transform()), coldStartStrategy=\"drop\" removes unseen pairs. For top-N recommendations, ALS relies on learned user embeddings and does not require explicit item input.\n",
    "\n",
    "It delivers actionable product recommendations and sentiment insights to enhance customer engagement and support data-driven decision-making in financial services."

    "### **Heatmap of Predicted Sentiments**\n",
    "The heatmap visualises the predicted sentiment of user reviews based on the trained NLP model. The sentiment score ranges from negative to positive, where lighter colors indicate more positive sentiments. This is helpful for quickly understanding user feedback and detecting areas that may need improvement in a product or service."
